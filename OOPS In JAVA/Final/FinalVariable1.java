/*
final keyword is used in different contexts. First of all, final is a non-access modifier 
applicable only to a 
> A variable, -> CONSTANT
> A method  --> Cannot be overriden
> A class --> cannot be Inerited
*/

/*
NOTE :--->  When a variable is declared with final keyword, its value canâ€™t be modified, 
essentially, a constant. This also means that you must initialize a final variable. 
If the final variable is a reference, this means that the variable cannot be re-bound 
to reference another object, but the internal state of the object pointed
 by that reference variable can be changed i.e. you can add or remove elements 
 from the final array or final collection. It is good practice to represent
  final variables in all uppercase, using underscore to separate words.

// Java Program to demonstrate
// Reference of Final Variable

// Main class
class GFG {

	// Main driver method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// Creating sn object of StringBuilder class
		// Final reference variable
		final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Geeks");

		// Printing the element in StringBuilder object
		System.out.println(sb);

		// changing internal state of object reference by
		// final reference variable sb
		sb.append("ForGeeks");

		// Again printing the element in StringBuilder
		// object after appending above element in it
		System.out.println(sb);
	}
}
/* The non-transitivity property also applies to arrays, 
because arrays are objects in java. Arrays with the final keyword
 are also called final arrays.
